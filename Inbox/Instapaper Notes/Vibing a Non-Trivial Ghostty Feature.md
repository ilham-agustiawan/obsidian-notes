> I don't send the agent off to build the full feature. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213240)

> smaller chunks of work are easier to review, understand, and iterate on. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213241)

> only create a plan and not to write any code. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213242)

> it's important that I review a plan before it goes off and does a ton of work (and spends a ton of tokens doing it). [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213243)

> Creating a comprehensive plan interactively with an agent is a really important first-step for anything non-trivial. I usually also save it out (via the agent) to something like spec.md and in future sessions I can say "Consult the @spec.md and work on some task".

> If the agent figures it out and I don't understand it, I back it out. I'm not shipping code I don't understand. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213245)

> While it's failing, I'm also tabbed out searching the issue and trying to figure it out myself. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213246)

> It's time to educate myself and think critically. AI is no longer the solution; it is a liability. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213248)

> Adding documentation is a really important step because it helps reaffirm your own understanding of the code as well as educate future agents that may read and modify this code. I find agents do much better when they have both natural language descriptions as well as the code itself. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213249)

> I manually created a file with a scaffold of incomplete functions and various TODO comments. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213252)

> AI is very good at fill-in-the-blank or draw-the-rest-of-the-owl. My pattern here of creating scaffolding with descriptive function names, parameters, todo comments, etc. is a really common one for me and it works very well. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213253)

> "I broke a bunch of things, please fix my mess." is another frequent use case I have for agents. I'd say generally this fits within the same fill-in-the-blank pattern as before. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213257)

> I do this regardless of if I manually wrote the code myself or not. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213258)

> Please don't ever ship AI-written code without a thorough manual review. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1915953436/26213266)
