> Gear Acquisition Syndrome, also known as GAS, is commonly understood as the musicians’ unrelenting urge to buy and own instruments and equipment as an anticipated catalyst of creative energy and bringer of happiness. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204129)

> Demonstrate a commitment to the activity before you think about buying anything to support it [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204132)

> In the beginning it’s more important to make a habit out of the activity, or discover that you don’t actually like it. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204134)

> One measure of commitment to an activity is whether you’re wearing out my gear and using up your materials. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204136)

> Goodhart’s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204138)

> If you physically need gear to do the thing, start with cheap gear and keep research to the minimum. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204139)

> As a beginner you can’t percieve most of the differences between similar tools. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204140)

> Perceptual ability and taste only develop as your skills improve. It’s easy to get caught in “analysis paralysis”, comparing gear that would be indistinguishable to you in practise. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204142)

> As you become committed to an activity and your skills improve, you will start to notice real flaws and limitations in your current tools. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204143)

> Crappy gear or not, you are going to do the thing anyway. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204144)

> So when you finally get the better tool, you mostly feel relief from the benefits of using it, rather than excitement or “inspiration” to use it. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1938354417/26204145)
