> Those things are not just questions, they are accusations. And, unfortunately, they do not stop. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761649)

> I’ve lost count of how many projects I have started that began with some variation of “Yeah, I could build this but better.” [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761652)

> If you ask me, I was solving real, innocent problems. But in hindsight, I was also feeding something else: a compulsion to assert control. Every new tool I built was a sandbox I owned: No weird bugs. No legacy constraints. No decisions I didn’t entirely agree with. Until, of course, I became the legacy.

> If you replace every part of the system over time, is it still the same tool? Does it still serve the same purpose? Do you? [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761656)

> It is, I admit, a seductive lie. It frames programming as a conquest of sorts. A series of battles you win, or challenges you complete. But the imaginary war never ends. You don’t build a castle. You dig trenches. And they flood every time it rains. The trials are never complete. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761658)

> That kind of agency is addictive. Especially when the rest of life doesn’t offer it. We program because we can, even when we shouldn’t. Because at least it gives us something to rebel against. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761661)

> Burnout does not just come from overwork. It comes from overresponsibility. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761662)

> The first step is recognizing that not everything broken is yours to fix.
> Not every tool needs replacing.
> Not every bad experience is a call to action. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761665)

> Sometimes, it’s OK to just use the thing. Sometimes it’s enough to know why it’s broken—even if you don’t fix it. Sometimes the most disciplined thing you can do is walk away from the problem you know how to solve. There’s a kind of strength in that.

> Not apathy, no. Nor laziness. Just… some restraint. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761667)

> I just want to feel OK in a world that often isn’t. I can fix something, but not everything. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198053/25761669)
