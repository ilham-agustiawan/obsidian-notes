> More people should do what I’m doing right now. They should sit at their computers and bat the cursor around — write full sentences about themselves and the things they care about. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761675)

> You should write because when you know that you’re going to write, it changes the way you live [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761682)

> She’s trying to generate questions. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761686)

> That’s the promise: you will live more curiously if you write [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761688)

> You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761690)

> Writing needn’t be a formal enterprise to have this effect. You don’t have to write well. You don’t even have to “write,” exactly — you can just talk onto the page. [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761697)

> You’ll become closer, too, to whoever you share your thoughts with, and odds are you'll draw the same thoughtfulness out of them [↗](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1884198273/25761700)
