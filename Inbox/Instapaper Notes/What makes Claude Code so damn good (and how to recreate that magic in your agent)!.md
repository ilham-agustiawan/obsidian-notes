> Over 50% of all important LLM calls made by CC are to claude-3-5-haiku. It is used to read large files, parse web pages, process git history and summarize long conversations. It is also used to come up with the one-word processing label - literally for every key stroke! The smaller models are 70-80% cheaper than the standard ones (Sonnet 4, GPT-4.1). Use them liberally!
