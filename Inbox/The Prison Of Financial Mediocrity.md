“We need willpower,” says Frog.

“What is willpower?” asks Toad.

“Willpower is trying hard not to do something that you really want to do,” says Frog.

Grown-ups, too, understand this struggle. In surveys, American adults have cited lack of willpower as [the top barrier](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://www.apaservices.org/practice/update/2012/02-23/willpower) to changing behavior. Around the world, when adults have rated themselves on two dozen positive qualities, self-control has ranked [dead last](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2014.888580). Research also [shows](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20565167/) that exercising willpower feels pretty awful, whether you are resisting something fun or forcing yourself to do something unfun.

Especially at this time of year, when holiday treats and year-end sales confront us at every turn, willing ourselves to resist can feel Scrooge-like. So we indulge. Then, come January, millions of us make New Year’s resolutions with fierce determination, only to abandon them by February.

The logical solution seems obvious: Try harder. Strengthen your willpower muscle. “Just say no,” as Nancy Reagan admonished my generation. “Just do it,” as Nike urges. Yet, as a psychologist who studies how people achieve their goals, I see the data leading to the opposite conclusion: Willpower is overrated.

Research shows that achievement has surprisingly little to do with forcing yourself to choose wisely in the heat of the moment. Successful people rarely rely on inner fortitude to resist temptations. Instead, many exercise situational agency, arranging their lives to [minimize the need for willpower](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736542/) in the first place.

It can feel embarrassing or even shameful to admit you lack the fortitude to make farsighted choices when temptation beckons. But interviews with some of the most disciplined people on the planet have taught me that you do hard things more consistently when you put yourself in situations that make the pursuit easier.

For instance, Alistair Brownlee, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the triathlon, makes sure his equipment is in order before a workout and that his shoes are warm, dry and waiting for him at the door. He bought his first house because it was close to the trails and pools where he ran and swam. “My mantra in life has always been to take the first step,” he says. Did all that situational scaffolding erode his grit? Quite the opposite.

You don’t need to be an elite athlete to benefit from situational agency. People are more likely to exercise when the situation [makes exercise more fun](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://hbr.org/tip/2017/09/make-achieving-your-long-term-goals-more-fun-in-the-short-term-2), research shows. Taking a walk outdoors, rather than on a treadmill at the gym, is the only way I get my steps in. My daughters have discovered that going to the gym is double the fun when they go together. Many other people find it easier to exercise when [bundling their workout](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4381662/) with a favorite podcast or audiobook.

Instead of admonishing my students to try harder to stay off their phones, I confess that I, too, find myself checking my texts, notifications and email [far more often than I’d like](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQnmBN9grI).

Random-assignment experiments confirm the causal role of putting temptations out of sight and out of reach. Adults encouraged to keep unhealthy foods at a distance [ate healthier](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220949813) days later. Students encouraged to apply the same strategy to distractions in their immediate surroundings later [reported more success](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4856169/) in pursuing their academic goals and felt less tempted while doing so.

Institutions also have the power to change situations for the better. In schools that ask students to keep phones in their hallway lockers, as opposed to in their backpacks or back pockets, teachers report that students [make more eye contact](https://archive.is/o/cLTUP/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld2ywYq7feo) with one another. They talk. The lunchroom is louder, the way it should be.

You cannot change the conditions of modern life, but you are the sovereign of what enters your personal space. Physical distance creates psychological distance: Draw close what you want more of; push away what you want less.
